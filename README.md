## Introduction

This repository is designed to help developers and students understand the foundational concepts of data structures and algorithms in Python. Each module is accompanied by well-documented code and explanations, making it easier to grasp the theory and apply it in practice.

### Data Structures

- **Arrays**
  - Basic operations: insertion, deletion, and traversal.
  - Searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search.

- **Linked Lists**
  - Implementation of singly linked lists.
  - Operations: insertion, deletion, and reversal of linked lists.

- **Stacks**
  - Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
  - Applications: balanced parentheses checking, expression evaluation.

- **Queues**
  - Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
  - Concepts: circular queues, dequeues.

- **Trees**
  - Types: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees.
  - Tree traversal techniques: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder.

- **Graphs**
  - Graph representations: adjacency lists, matrices.
  - Graph traversal techniques: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search).

- **Hash Tables**
  - Implementation of hash tables.
  - Collision resolution techniques: chaining, open addressing.

### Algorithms

- **Sorting**
  - Implementation of sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

- **Searching**
  - Linear Search, Binary Search, and other advanced search algorithms.

- **Recursion**
  - Understanding recursion through examples like the Fibonacci series and Tower of Hanoi.

- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Techniques for solving problems like the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, etc.

- **Greedy Algorithms**
  - Implementation of greedy algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path, Huffman coding, etc.

- **Backtracking**
  - Solving problems using backtracking, such as N-Queens and Sudoku.
